                        <p>Dear {recipient_name},</p>
                        <p>I hope this email finds you well. My name is Shivam, 
                        and I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with nearly three years of experience in IT, 
                        focusing on developing and deploying scalable machine learning models and workflows. 
                        I came across your organization {company_name} and was impressed by your innovative work in the field 
                        of {company_work_related}. I would love to explore any opportunities where I could contribute my skills in AI and automation.</p>
                        
                        <p>Throughout my career, I have built expertise in Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, as well as DevOps tools such as Docker and Kubernetes. In my most recent role at Indus Valley Partners, I led the development of a custom monitoring system that automated the categorization of critical service alerts, reducing response times by 77%. I have also worked on machine learning projects, including an AI-powered image caption generator and an automated text summarization tool, demonstrating a track record of delivering impactful solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p>I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills in machine learning, DevOps, and cloud technologies could be valuable to your team. I am attaching my resume for your reference and would appreciate the opportunity to connect further.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.</p>

                        <p>Warm regards,<br/>
